## Academic Program
I am involved in the Saint Mary's College/University of Notre Dame Dual-Degree Engineering Program. It is a 4:1 program that results in degrees from both schools. The first four years, students attend Saint Mary's College but are taking classes on both campuses. After the fourth year, students graduate with their Saint Mary's College degree and transfer to the University of Notre Dame for thei fifth year. After completing their fifth year, students graduate from the University of Notre Dame with a Bachelor of Science from the College of Engineering.
